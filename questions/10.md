# Active Record: Migrations

Which of the following are reasons that we need to include a timestamp at the
beginning of a migration's filename? Select all that apply.

## Correct

It ensures that the migrations are run in the right order.

> Yes! The migrations will be run in the order they were created as indicated by
> the timestamp.

## Correct

It helps ensure that each migration is only run once.

> Yes! The timestamp is used like version control to ensure that migrations are
> only run once.

## Incorrect

Active Record uses the timestamp to figure out how to revert a migration.

> Try again! To roll back (undo) a migration, Active Record refers to content
> written in the migration in the `change` or `down` method (e.g., removing a
> table or column that was created; reversing a change made to a column), not
> the timestamp.

## Incorrect

It allows us to reuse the part of the filename after the timestamp for multiple
migration files.

> Try again! We want our filenames to be as descriptive as possible of the actual
> change being made, so it doesn't make sense to reuse names.
