# Active Record: Rake

Which syntax is used to define a Rake task?

## Correct

```
task :alert do
  puts "This is an important task"
end
```

> Perfect! We define tasks with `task :name_of_task_as_symbol` + code block we
> wish to execute.

## Incorrect

```
task :alert
  puts "This is an important task"
end
```

> Not quite. Something is missing. How do we denote the start of a block in Ruby?

## Incorrect

```
task .alert do
  puts "This is an important task"
end
```

> Something isn't right about the name of the task. What data type should that be?

## Incorrect

```
rake :alert do
  puts "This is an important task"
end
```

> Almost. We don't define tasks using `rake`. Which method do we use instead?

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
