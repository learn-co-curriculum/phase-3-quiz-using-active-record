# Active Record: Basics

We have a table storing the make and model of different cars. How can we find a
car by its make?

## Correct

```rb
Car.find_by(make: "DeLorean")
```

> Perfect! You can also use `Car.find_by_make("DeLorean")`

## Incorrect

```rb
Car.find(make: "DeLorean")
```

> Not quite. `.find` only searches by id. Which method should we use instead?

## Incorrect

```rb
Car.filter(make: "DeLorean")
```

> This seems like it could be a method, but it's not. Which method should we use
> instead?

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
