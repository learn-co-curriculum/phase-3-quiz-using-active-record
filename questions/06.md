# Active Record: Migrations

What are some of the benefits of using ActiveRecord migrations? (Select **all**
that apply)

## Correct

We no longer have to write SQL to create or change tables

> So true! We can use Ruby instead, though SQL is under the hood.

## Correct

It's like version control for your database - you can easily revert changes

> Yes! If we create a migration for every change we make, we have a history of
> changes available and we can undo them with more migrations.

## Incorrect

ActiveRecord re-executes every single migration for us any time we run `rake
db:migrate`

> Not quite. ActiveRecord tracks every migration we've ever run and will only run
> them once. That means that only new migrations will run.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
