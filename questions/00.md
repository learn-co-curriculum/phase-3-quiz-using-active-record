# Active Record: Basics

Consider the following code:

```rb
class Car
end
```

To make use of ActiveRecord's built-in ORM methods for this `Car` class, which
syntax is used?

## Correct

```rb
class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

> Correct! The `Car` class needs to inherit from the `ActiveRecord::Base` class
> in order to use its methods.

## Incorrect

```rb
class Car < ActiveRecord
end
```

> Almost. We actually need to inherit from a class namespaced within
> ActiveRecord. What is that class called and how do we access it?

## Incorrect

```rb
class Car < ActiveRecord:Base
end
```

> Almost. This isn't syntactically correct. How do we access a namespaced class,
> such as Base?

## Incorrect

```rb
class Car > ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

> Almost. Which symbol do we use to denote inheritance?

## Incorrect

I don't know.
