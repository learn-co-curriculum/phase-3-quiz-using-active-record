# Active Record: Basics

Consider the following code:

```
class Car
end
```

To make use of ActiveRecord's built-in ORM methods for
this&nbsp;`Car`&nbsp;class, which syntax is used?

## Correct

```
class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

> Correct! The Car class needs to inherit from the nested class (Base) within
> ActiveRecord in order to access its methods and attributes.

## Incorrect

```
class Car < ActiveRecord
end
```

> Almost. We actually need to inherit from a class nested within ActiveRecord.
> What is that class called and how do we access it?

## Incorrect

```
class Car < ActiveRecord:Base
end
```

> Almost. This isn't syntactically correct. How do we access a nested class, such
> as Base?

## Incorrect

```
class Car > ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

> Almost. Which symbol do we use to denote inheritance? Is it the greater than or
> the less than symbol?

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
