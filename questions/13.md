# Active Record: Migrations

&nbsp;Which of the following are reasons that we need to include a timestamp at
the beginning of a migration's filename? (select all that apply)

## Correct

It ensures that the migrations are run in the right order.

> Yes! The migrations will be run in the order they were created as indicated by
> the timestamp.

## Correct

It helps ensure that each migration is only run once.

> Yes! The timestamp is used in version control which ensures that migrations are
> only run once.

## Incorrect

Active Record uses the timestamp to figure out how to revert a migration.

> Try again!
> 
> For reverting a migration, Active Record refers to the **content** of the
> migration (e.g., removing a table or column that was created; reversing a change
> made to a column), not the timestamp.

## Incorrect

It allows us to reuse the part of the filename after the timestamp for multiple
migration files.

> Try again! We want our filenames to be as descriptive as possible of the actual
> change being made, so it doesn't make sense to reuse names.
