# Active Record: Migrations

What are some of the benefits of using Active Record migrations? (Select **all**
that apply)

## Correct

We no longer have to write SQL to create or change tables

> So true! We can use Ruby instead, and let Active Record generate the correct
> SQL under the hood.

## Correct

It's like version control for your database - you can easily revert changes

> Yes! If we create a migration for every change we make, we have a history of
> changes available and we can undo them with more migrations.

## Correct

Any developer working on our project can generate the same database from scratch

> Right on! Since all the instructions needed to generate the database is
> contained in the migration files, any developer who wants to work on our
> application can run the migrations to generate a database with the same
> structure.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
